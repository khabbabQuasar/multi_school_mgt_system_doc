* URL query parameters contain sensitive information such as personal details, authentication tokens, or sensitive identifiers, encryption can prevent unauthorized parties from easily intercepting and understanding this data.
* Encrypting query parameters helps ensure the integrity of the data by preventing tampering. Without the encryption key, attackers cannot modify the encrypted parameters to inject malicious data.
