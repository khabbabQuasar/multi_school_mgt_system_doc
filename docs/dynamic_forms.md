To accommodate the varying information requirements of different educational institutions during the registration process, the implementation of additional form fields becomes imperative.  

### `Role:` 
*        Administrative users possess the capability to seamlessly augment forms 
        by adding fields in a structured, section-wise manner .
### `Function :`
*        Superadmin Admin / Principal can add additional fields in the
         student and staff registration forms section-wise 
        (e.g. student details, parent's details, address, etc  ) . 
*        During user registration, the system dynamically presents the 
        configured fields in an organized fashion, aligning with their 
        designated sections. This dynamic rendering is accomplished
        through a responsive interface that fetches 
        the form's structural details from the underlying database.
