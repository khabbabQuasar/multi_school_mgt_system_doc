## Authentication and associated client identification    

* When a user is only registered in school he can log in to his associated center.
In the scenario where a client has two children attending different schools, both of which are our clients, and the user possesses identical credentials for both accounts, the user is required to choose which school they wish to log in to. To facilitate this, we have implemented a select center input that appears when the user registers in multiple schools, allowing them to make their selection. This process ensures seamless and personalized access for the user.
*  The user can change his password for the center where he logged in.
*  If a user previously possessed identical credentials for two different schools but now changed his password in the account in which he       logged   in. Now users have two different credentials for two different accounts.
